## Spotify

I chose to evaluate Spotify because it is an app that I, and millions of others, use everyday. I am interested in how the app’s design enhances or hinders its usability for the average user like me, who doesn’t actively analyze the app from a designer’s perspective. Given that Spotify is enormously popular, every element of its design must be extremely strategic, however subtle it may be.  

Spotify is a media service platform that allows users to stream and download music, podcasts, and other forms of audio media. Users can access Spotify through a mobile app, which allows them to personalize, organize, and share music and other media. __________________


### 1 Visibility of System Status

Spotify does a good job of keeping the user informed on the system status of the app. For example, users know when a song is paused or playing due to the recognizable “play” and “pause” icon in the center of the screen. In addition, users know when the app is buffering or has weak connection because an “reconnecting…” message appears at the bottom of the screen. 

Score: 1

### 2 Match Between System and the Real World

Spotify uses conventional language and intuitive design that reflects real world trends. It uses commonly known words like “albums”, “artists”, “pause”, and “playlists”. The album interface is somewhat skeuomorphic in design as musical albums and playlists resemble the physical albums in the real world. In addition, skipping from song to song feels similar to turning pages in a physical book. Overall, Spotify uses consumer friendly language and design elements that intuitively resemble real world objects and processes.

Score: 1

### 3 User Control and Freedom

The app lends the user much freedom by including redo functions throughout. For instance, if a listener accidentally skips a song, he/she can simply press the back arrow button to the left of the play button to return to the previous song. When navigating playlists, a user can tap to see the contents of a playlist and easily back out by clicking the left-pointing arrow in the upper left hand corner of the screen. Spotify excels in giving the user a sense of freedom and control.

Score: 1


### 4 Consistency and Standards

Internal Consistency: Everything within Spotify is consistent. Playlists are all depicted as square album-like images with a bolded white title to the right of them. Any song, playlist, or album that is downloaded onto the local device is accompanied by a green circle with a black arrow pointing down. The listening interface is consistent from song to song, with a pause/play button in the lower middle of the screen, above which sits a timeline bar indicating the time surpassed as the music plays. Every song title is bolded in white, and its artist is written below in light gray.

External Consistency: Spotify is mostly consistent with other music/media applications such as Apple Music. Its interface features the conventional layout, with the pause/play button centered on the screen and left and right arrows allowing users to skip to the next/previous songs. The language that Spotify uses is pretty universal. Both Apple Music and Spotify allow users to create custom “playlists” or to download “albums”.  Overall, Spotify is internally consistent as well as new-user friendly due to its strong external consistency. 

Score: 1

### 5 Error Prevention

Spotify has effective error prevention methods, but the app is still vulnerable to user error. For example, a user may accidentally swipe to download an album, which automatically begins downloading the album contents. Spotify does not give you an “Are you sure?” notification. Beyond small errors like accidentally skipping or pausing songs, Spotify’s design work well in preventing errors. If a user want to delete an entire playlist, he/she have to navigate through several dropdowns, making this difficult to do on accident. In addition, if a user accidentally undownloads all songs from a playlist, he/she will be prompted with an “Are you sure?” message. In sum, Spotify fails to prevent small user errors, but its overall design forces users to be deliberate in larger-stake actions, thus preventing costly errors. 

Score: 2
