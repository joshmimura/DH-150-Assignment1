DH 150: UX

## Spotify

I chose to evaluate Spotify because it is an app that I, and millions of others, use everyday. I am interested in how the app’s design enhances or hinders its usability for the average user like me, who doesn’t actively analyze the app from a designer’s perspective. Given that Spotify is enormously popular, every element of its design must be extremely strategic, however subtle it may be.  

Spotify is a media service platform that allows users to stream and download music, podcasts, and other forms of audio media. Users can access Spotify through a mobile app, which allows them to personalize, organize, and share music and other media. __________________


### 1 Visibility of System Status

Spotify does a good job of keeping the user informed on the system status of the app. For example, users know when a song is paused or playing due to the recognizable “play” and “pause” icon in the center of the screen. In addition, users know when the app is buffering or has weak connection because an “reconnecting…” message appears at the bottom of the screen. 

Score: 1

### 2 Match Between System and the Real World

Spotify uses conventional language and intuitive design that reflects real world trends. It uses commonly known words like “albums”, “artists”, “pause”, and “playlists”. The album interface is somewhat skeuomorphic in design as musical albums and playlists resemble the physical albums in the real world. In addition, skipping from song to song feels similar to turning pages in a physical book. Overall, Spotify uses consumer friendly language and design elements that intuitively resemble real world objects and processes.

Score: 1

### 3 User Control and Freedom

The app lends the user much freedom by including redo functions throughout. For instance, if a listener accidentally skips a song, he/she can simply press the back arrow button to the left of the play button to return to the previous song. When navigating playlists, a user can tap to see the contents of a playlist and easily back out by clicking the left-pointing arrow in the upper left hand corner of the screen. Spotify excels in giving the user a sense of freedom and control.

Score: 1


### 4 Consistency and Standards

Internal Consistency: Everything within Spotify is consistent. Playlists are all depicted as square album-like images with a bolded white title to the right of them. Any song, playlist, or album that is downloaded onto the local device is accompanied by a green circle with a black arrow pointing down. The listening interface is consistent from song to song, with a pause/play button in the lower middle of the screen, above which sits a timeline bar indicating the time surpassed as the music plays. Every song title is bolded in white, and its artist is written below in light gray.

External Consistency: Spotify is mostly consistent with other music/media applications such as Apple Music. Its interface features the conventional layout, with the pause/play button centered on the screen and left and right arrows allowing users to skip to the next/previous songs. The language that Spotify uses is pretty universal. Both Apple Music and Spotify allow users to create custom “playlists” or to download “albums”.  Overall, Spotify is internally consistent as well as new-user friendly due to its strong external consistency. 

Score: 1

### 5 Error Prevention

Spotify has effective error prevention methods, but the app is still vulnerable to user error. For example, a user may accidentally swipe to download an album, which automatically begins downloading the album contents. Spotify does not give you an “Are you sure?” notification. Beyond small errors like accidentally skipping or pausing songs, Spotify’s design work well in preventing errors. If a user want to delete an entire playlist, he/she have to navigate through several dropdowns, making this difficult to do on accident. In addition, if a user accidentally undownloads all songs from a playlist, he/she will be prompted with an “Are you sure?” message. In sum, Spotify fails to prevent small user errors, but its overall design forces users to be deliberate in larger-stake actions, thus preventing costly errors. 

Score: 2


### 6 Recognition Over Recall 

Spotify's app rarely demands that the user recalls any specific information. If a user wants to find certain music, they can look up a genre, author, or keywords, and the app's search enginge will provide a list of suggestions. These suggestions are recognizable and make music navigation quicker and easier. In addition, playlists in Spotify are supplemented with an album-like images that contain pictures of the albums within the playlist. This allows the user to recognize playlist content by the album covers rather than forcing him/her to memorize which specific songs are in that music file. In all, Spotify's emphasis on recognition-based navigation over recall-based navigation enhances the app's usability and experience. 

Score: 1
 

### 7 Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

Spotify's design allows expert music enthusiasts and music beginners to operate the app with ease and enjoyment. Experienced users can create an array of playlists and share them with others. They can create a music queue that specifies the exact order of music they listen to and can favorite certain songs while removing others. People who are less enthusiastic and want a simple experience don't even need to construct a custom playlist. They can tap on a genre of music, and music will begin playing. They can listen to music without needing to know how to use the more complicated features of Spotify. Therefore, Spotify is flexible and efficient; it provides inexperienced with an enjoyable musical experience while allowing expert music enthusiasts to build a complex, organized collection of media. 

Score: 1

### 8 Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

Spotify's interface features a black, green, and white color palette, consistent fonts, and an intuitive directory style navigation method. The simple and modern aesthetics make operating the app a simple and stress-free experience. In addition, the design is as minimalist as can be. For example, only the most relevant information is given on the music listening interface: the song title, author name, and a live time indicator. The interface does not include secondarily relevant information, but if a user is intersted in a certain song, they can tap on the album for more information. In sum, Spotify's design is straightforward and aesthetically pleasing. Relevant information only is provided in an unambiguous way, and if users want to learn more, Spotify allows them to by including subtle design actions that do not clutter the interface. 

Score: 1

### 9 Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

Spotify does a decent job of notifying the user of errors and how to recover from them. For instance, if a user is offline, the app notifies him/her with a message: "No Internet Connection. Go online and try again." If a user attempts to download too many songs, Spotify will prompt the user with an error message explaining that the user is out of storage. Also, non-premium users who try to engage in premium member actions will be notified of this restriction and what they need to do to become a premium member (granted, this feels more like a marketing technique than a error processing design strategy). Spotify does the bare minimum when it comes to diagnosing and suggesting solutions to errors. It tells the user what the issue is, but it does not explain any solutions in much detail. Therefore, error processes could be an area of improvement for Spotify.

Score: 2
